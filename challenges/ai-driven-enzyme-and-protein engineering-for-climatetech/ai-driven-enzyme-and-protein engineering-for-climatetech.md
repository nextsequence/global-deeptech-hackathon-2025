​​​​🧩 Suggested Themes & Challenges:
​
<br>
<br>
​What is are biomining available datasets? <br>

<br>
<br>
​1. Rare Earth Element Biomining with Engineered E. coli <br>
<br>
​What it is: Adsorption data for terbium (Tb) onto engineered E. coli with lanthanide-binding tags, tested across temperatures up to 100 °C in synthetic Great Salt Lake brine. Data is in Excel format with ICP-MS measurements. AmeriGEOSS DataData.gov <br>
<br>

​Why it matters: Useful for modeling temperature-dependent metal adsorption and microbial optimization in biomining contexts. <br>
<br>
<br>

​2. Omics Data on Acidophile Biofilms in Metal Extraction <br>

<br>
​What it is: Systems biology datasets—including proteomics, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and fluorescence microscopy—focused on acidophilic biofilms (e.g., Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans, Acidithiobacillus caldus) involved in metal-extraction. Accessible via FAIRDOMHub, with raw RNA-seq available in ENA and proteomics in PRIDE. NaturePMC <br>
<br>

​Why it matters: Offers a high-resolution view of gene and protein expression in bioleaching scenarios—valuable for dissecting mechanisms underlying microbial metal extraction. <br>
<br>

​3. Metabolomics of Chilean Biomining Bacteria <br>
<br>

​What it is: Metabolite profiles (using CE-MS) of A. ferrooxidans strain Wenelen and A. thiooxidans strain Licanantay grown with different substrates (iron, sulfur, chalcopyrite), in both sessile and planktonic states. Reveals key metabolites like glutathione and spermidine. PMCPubMed <br>
<br>

​Why it matters: Illuminates metabolic pathways crucial for biofilm formation and metal oxidation—especially sulfur and energy metabolism—within biomining microorganisms. <br>
<br>

​Broader Repositories and Resources <br>
​4. “Awesome-mining-data” (GitHub Repository) <br>
<br>

​What it is: A curated list of open datasets related to the mining industry—not limited to biomining—including geological, geophysical, chemical, and assay data such as: <br>
<br>

​Thalanga (2024): Drilling, geology, geophysics <br>
<br>

​GeoMet (2022): Geochemical analyses <br>

​Macpass (2023): Drillholes and topography <br>

​Other synthetic or real datasets (e.g., Porphyry, MineLib) GitHub <br>

​Why it matters: While not microbial-centric, these data sources can support cross-disciplinary modeling, simulation, and integration of biomining processes within geological contexts. <br>
<br>

​5. National Microbiology Data Center (NMDC) <br>
<br>

​What it is: A large-scale Chinese microbiological data hub integrating over 800 databases and 6 petabytes of data, including microbial omics, strain catalogs, and more. Databases include the Global Catalogue of Microorganisms, type strain genomes, and standardized microbiome analyses (gcMeta). Wikipedia <br>
<br>

​Why it matters: Excellent source for reference genomes, strain-level data, and comparative analysis—especially for extremophiles used in biomining. <br>

<br>

​Suggestions for Next Steps <br>
​Define Your Objective: Are you modeling adsorption kinetics, exploring microbial gene expression, or integrating geochemical context? The best dataset depends on your research angle.
<br>
<br>

​Integrate Multiple Layers: Consider combining metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets (e.g., omics + metabolite profiles) to build mechanistic models of biomining activity. <br>
<br>
<br>

​Expand Scope with Geodata: If your work involves simulating ore environments or designing experiments, geoscience datasets (from Awesome-mining-data) provide helpful context. <br>
<br>
<br>

​Explore NMDC for Strain-Level Comparisons: Use genomic or microbial catalog data from NMDC to compare strains or support discovery of biomining-relevant patterns. <br>
<br>
<br>

​From the Community: Share and Discover Datasets <br>
​Here's a relevant thought from practitioners browsing biomining and related domains: <br>
<br>

​“On NCBI GEO/SRA you will find almost all type of biological dataset. Just try to reproduce one already published.” Reddit <br>
<br>
​If you haven't yet explored NCBI GEO/SRA, those repositories might also house biomining-relevant transcriptomics, proteomics, or metagenomics data—especially from mining-related microbial studies. <br>
