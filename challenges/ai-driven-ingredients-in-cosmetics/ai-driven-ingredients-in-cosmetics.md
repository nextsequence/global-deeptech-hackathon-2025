🧩 Suggested Themes & Challenges: <br>
<br>
​Offer 3–4 focused tracks, drawing inspiration from existing hackathons like the Harvard Rare Disease Hackathon HARVARD RARE DISEASE HACKATHON: <br>

<br>
​Genomic Diagnostics in Dermatology <br>
​Create tools to analyze variants for skin disease diagnosis.<br>

<br>
​Spatial & Single-Cell Skin Omics <br>
​Utilize tools like Tangram, CellChat, spatialLIBD to explore skin spatial transcriptomics skincenter.uci.edu. <br>

<br>
​AI for Skin Lesion Analysis <br>
​Build apps or models for lesion classification, inspired by Skinskan’s melanoma detection model GitHub. <br>

<br>
​Ethics, Equity & Data Privacy in Skin Genomics <br>
​Address biases in genomic datasets or explore the ethics and privacy implications in skin genetics analysis. <br>
<br>
<br>
​Each track can offer 2–3 problem prompts, e.g.,: "Build a variant interpretation interface for vitiligo-related genes," or "Train a lightweight classifier for early detection of melanoma."

<br>
​What is are the skin genomics available datasets?<br>

​1. Image-based Skin Datasets (Dermatologic Images) <br>
​These are widely used for computer vision, diagnostics, and ML model development: <br>

<br>
​ISIC Archive <br>
A large and rich collection of dermatoscopic images incorporating multiple datasets: HAM10000 (10,015 images), BCN20000 (~19,424), Patient-Centric (~33,126), and others—totaling over 76,000 public images as of May 2024 arXiv. <br>

<br>
​DERM12345 <br>
Offers 12,345 high-resolution dermatoscopic images with 38 carefully annotated subclasses, enhancing granularity beyond traditional datasets arXiv. <br>

<br>
​HAM10000 <br>
A classic benchmark with 10,015 dermatoscopic images covering seven major diagnostic categories, many with pathology-confirmed labels arXiv. <br>

<br>
​BCN20000 <br>
Comprising ~19,424 dermoscopic images including challenging lesion types (nails, mucosal, large lesions) from a real clinical environment arXiv. <br>

<br>
​PAD-UFES-20 <br>
Contains 2,298 clinical (smartphone) images representing six diagnostic categories, with 58% biopsy-confirmed lesions arXiv. Great for real-world, non-dermoscopic scenarios. <br>

<br>
​Hyper-Skin <br>
A hyperspectral dataset (330 hyperspectral cubes from 51 subjects), enabling advanced research on skin reflectance, melanin, and hemoglobin – paired with synthetic RGB images arXiv. <br>

<br>
​SCIN (Skin Condition Image Network) <br>
Google’s crowd-sourced dataset: over 10,000 images from volunteer contributions, annotated with dermatologist labels, self-reported Fitzpatrick skin types, and Monk Skin Tone estimates. A valuable dataset for diversity and metadata-rich analysis GitHub. <br>

<br>
​Others: <br>
DermaMNIST, SD-198, Fitzpatrick17k, Derm7pt, etc., are summarized in an “awesome‐skin‐image‐analysis‐datasets” GitHub list GitHub. <br>

<br>
​2. Molecular & Genomic Skin Datasets <br>
​Less common but critical for understanding gene expression, proteomics, and cellular composition in skin: <br>

 <br>
​GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression project) <br>
A foundational resource with gene expression (plus genotypes, QTLs, histology) across 54 nondiseased human tissue sites, including skin PMC. <br>

<br>
​Human Skinatlas <br>
A spatially resolved quantitative proteomics atlas created with flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, detailing different skin layers and cell types in healthy human skin PMC. <br>

<br>
​Expression Atlas (EMBL-EBI) <br>
Offers standardized gene (and protein) expression data across conditions, including baseline and differential expression—searchable by tissue or disease Wikipedia. <br>

<br>
​Human Protein Atlas <br> 
Maps gene and protein expression in 44 human tissues (including skin) at mRNA and protein levels, with single-cell and immunohistochemistry data Wikipedia. <br>

<br>
​FANTOM5 <br>
Transcriptome profiling across a large array of human tissues and primary cells via CAGE; may include skin samples among its 1,816 human profiles Wikipedia. <br>

<br>
​Bgee database <br>
Curated gene expression data (RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, microarray) across species, used for identifying where genes are expressed under healthy conditions—includes human skin Wikipedia. <br>

<br>
​Single-cell & Multi-omics Resources (e.g. via skinregeneration.org) <br>
Various mouse and human skin scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, including samples from diseased and regenerative skin, fat cell subsets, eccrine glands, and more skinregeneration.org. <br>

 <br>
​Targeted In Situ Panels <br>
E.g., 10x Genomics Xenium Human Skin Gene Expression Panel, targeting 282 genes across skin cell types (keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells) with spatial resolution 10x Genomics+1.
