​What is are the skin genomics available datasets?
​1. Image-based Skin Datasets (Dermatologic Images)
​These are widely used for computer vision, diagnostics, and ML model development:

​ISIC Archive
A large and rich collection of dermatoscopic images incorporating multiple datasets: HAM10000 (10,015 images), BCN20000 (~19,424), Patient-Centric (~33,126), and others—totaling over 76,000 public images as of May 2024 arXiv.

​DERM12345
Offers 12,345 high-resolution dermatoscopic images with 38 carefully annotated subclasses, enhancing granularity beyond traditional datasets arXiv.

​HAM10000
A classic benchmark with 10,015 dermatoscopic images covering seven major diagnostic categories, many with pathology-confirmed labels arXiv.

​BCN20000
Comprising ~19,424 dermoscopic images including challenging lesion types (nails, mucosal, large lesions) from a real clinical environment arXiv.

​PAD-UFES-20
Contains 2,298 clinical (smartphone) images representing six diagnostic categories, with 58% biopsy-confirmed lesions arXiv. Great for real-world, non-dermoscopic scenarios.

​Hyper-Skin
A hyperspectral dataset (330 hyperspectral cubes from 51 subjects), enabling advanced research on skin reflectance, melanin, and hemoglobin – paired with synthetic RGB images arXiv.

​SCIN (Skin Condition Image Network)
Google’s crowd-sourced dataset: over 10,000 images from volunteer contributions, annotated with dermatologist labels, self-reported Fitzpatrick skin types, and Monk Skin Tone estimates. A valuable dataset for diversity and metadata-rich analysis GitHub.

​Others:
DermaMNIST, SD-198, Fitzpatrick17k, Derm7pt, etc., are summarized in an “awesome‐skin‐image‐analysis‐datasets” GitHub list GitHub.

​2. Molecular & Genomic Skin Datasets
​Less common but critical for understanding gene expression, proteomics, and cellular composition in skin:

​GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression project)
A foundational resource with gene expression (plus genotypes, QTLs, histology) across 54 nondiseased human tissue sites, including skin PMC.

​Human Skinatlas
A spatially resolved quantitative proteomics atlas created with flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, detailing different skin layers and cell types in healthy human skin PMC.

​Expression Atlas (EMBL-EBI)
Offers standardized gene (and protein) expression data across conditions, including baseline and differential expression—searchable by tissue or disease Wikipedia.

​Human Protein Atlas
Maps gene and protein expression in 44 human tissues (including skin) at mRNA and protein levels, with single-cell and immunohistochemistry data Wikipedia.

​FANTOM5
Transcriptome profiling across a large array of human tissues and primary cells via CAGE; may include skin samples among its 1,816 human profiles Wikipedia.

​Bgee database
Curated gene expression data (RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, microarray) across species, used for identifying where genes are expressed under healthy conditions—includes human skin Wikipedia.

​Single-cell & Multi-omics Resources (e.g. via skinregeneration.org)
Various mouse and human skin scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, including samples from diseased and regenerative skin, fat cell subsets, eccrine glands, and more skinregeneration.org.

​Targeted In Situ Panels
E.g., 10x Genomics Xenium Human Skin Gene Expression Panel, targeting 282 genes across skin cell types (keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells) with spatial resolution 10x Genomics+1.
