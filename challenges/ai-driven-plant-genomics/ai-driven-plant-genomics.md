​What is are the plants genomics available datasets? <br>
<br>
<br>
​Leading Genomic & Multi-Omics Datasets: <br>

​1001 Genomes Project (Arabidopsis thaliana): <br>
<br>

​Offers whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for 1,135 natural inbred accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, with VCFs, SNP matrices, and pseudogenomes available for download. 1001genomes.org1001genomes.org <br>
<br>

​Includes epigenetic (methylome) and transcriptomic data: ~1,107 methylomes and ~1,203 transcriptomes from overlapping accessions. PubMedviennabiocenter.orgCell <br>
<br>

​This makes it a standout dataset for exploring genome–epigenome–transcriptome interplays. viennabiocenter.orgCellPubMedNature <br>
<br>

​Community threads confirm: <br>
<br>

​“The Arabidopsis 1001 genomes project contains both WGBS and WGS data for many of their accessions.” Reddit <br>
<br>
​AGP: Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics Dataset:<br>
<br>

​A cutting-edge, multi-modal dataset released in August 2025 that for the first time integrates gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements for the same Arabidopsis thaliana specimens. <br>
<br>

​Designed especially for machine learning tasks, like phenotype prediction and graph-based modeling. arXiv <br>
<br>

​Foundational Databases for Comparative & Crop Genomics <br>
​Phytozome: A comprehensive repository of plant genomic data across numerous green plant species—excellent for comparative genomics with integrated annotations. cd-genomics.com <br>
<br>

​Ensembl Plants (part of Ensembl Genomes): Provides genome sequences and annotated data for dozens of key plant species such as Arabidopsis, rice, maize, wheat, grape, and more, all accessible through tools like BioMart. Wikipediaplants.ensembl.org <br>
<br>

​Species‐Specific Databases: <br>
<br>

​TAIR (Arabidopsis): Genome annotations, gene function, variants, phenotypes, and seed stock info. Public data is released after one year; subscriptions required for immediate access. Wikipedia <br>
<br>

​SoyBase: In-depth SNP, genetic maps, QTL, and functional genomic data for soybean (Glycine max). Wikipedia <br>
<br>

​SolGenomics Network, CassavaBase, CucurbitDB, YamBase, etc.: Tailored for specific crop families like nightshade, cucurbits, banana, radish, etc. Boyce Thompson Institute <br>
<br>

​PlantPan (Pan-Genomics): A pan-genome database that spans 195 genomes in 11 plant species, with extensive gene clusters, variance data, synteny, functional annotations (GO, KEGG, TFs, etc.). PMC <br>
<br>

​PGP Repository (Plant Phenomics and Genomics): A German EU-funded infrastructure allowing publication and long-term DOI citable storage of large-scale multi-domain plant genomics and phenomics data, fully compliant with FAIR principles. Wikipedia+1 <br>
<br>

​Earth BioGenome Project / 10KP Pilot: Ambitious planetary-scale effort: as of late 2024, 2,000+ plant species have chromosome-level assemblies. These ecosystems-scale datasets pave the way for massive comparative studies.
