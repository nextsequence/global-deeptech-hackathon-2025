â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ðŸ§© Suggested Themes & Challenges: <br>
â€‹
<br>
â€‹What is are the biomaterials available datasets? <br>
â€‹1. Experimental / Properties Data <br>
â€‹Biomolecular Adsorption Database 2.0 (BAD2.0) <br>
A specialized database capturing protein adsorption onto biomaterial surfaces, with detailed descriptors like protein identity, surface properties, and environmental conditions. Over 865 adsorption records, fully quantitative and update from 2024. Wikipedia <br>

<br>
â€‹Global Clinical Trials Dataset Involving Engineered Biomaterials <br>
A structured dataset created from ClinicalTrials.gov, containing metadata such as biomaterial type, properties, application context, and trial attributes. Great for analysis of translational trends. Zenodo <br>

<br>
â€‹FTIR & Raman Datasets for Biomaterials with Drug Loading <br>
Specialized spectral datasets focusing on biomaterials after loading with carboplatin drugâ€”helpful for chemical and structural fingerprinting. Figshare+1 <br>

 <br>
â€‹GelMA/Alginate Hydrogels Fabrication Dataset <br>
Published on Figshare in early 2025, this dataset pertains to blood vessel fabrication using hydrogels, with relevance to 3D biofabrication and property optimization. Figshare <br>

<br>
â€‹2. Text/NLP-Focused Corpora for Biomaterials Literature <br>
â€‹Developed under the Horizon Europe BIOMATDB initiative, these corpora are invaluable if you're building NLP tools for extracting biomaterial-related information from scientific papers. <br>

<br>
â€‹BIOMAT-NER: Contains annotations of biomaterial types, chemical substances, and trade names across ~4,553 training documents, plus validation and test sets. Zenodo+1 <br>

<br>
â€‹BIOMAT-MONER: Focused on "manufactured object" entitiesâ€”tools, devices, implantsâ€”with 750 train and 100 validation documents. Zenodo <br>

<br>
â€‹BIOMAT-CellNER: Annotated for cell types and cell lines interacting with biomaterials, similar train/validation size. Zenodo <br>

<br>
â€‹BIOMAT-AnatNER: Focused on anatomical structures (tissues, organs) in biomaterials context. Zenodo <br>

<br>
â€‹3. Computational & Structural Materials Data <br>
<br>
â€‹Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) <br>
A massive open dataset with over 110 million DFT-calculated inorganic material structures. Itâ€™s paired with pre-trained models (EquiformerV2) capable of predicting properties like stability and formation energyâ€”ideal for ML-driven materials discovery. arXivReddit <br>

<br>
â€‹"Awesome-Biomaterials-DataScience" GitHub List <br>
A living resource aggregating databases and toolsâ€”including DEBBIE (Experimental Biomaterials), MatWeb, Spider Silkome database, and more. Not a single dataset, but a goldmine for discovering resources. GitHub
