ðŸ§© Suggested Themes & Challenges: <br>
<br>
â€‹Antibody Engineering <br>
Design or analyze antibody structures using tools like iCn3D. This approach has been successfully implemented in previous hackathons, where students investigated commercially available anti-spike protein antibodies and assessed their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Micro Nano Technology Education Center

<br>
â€‹Immune Cell Image Analysis <br>
Develop AI models to identify and quantify immune cells in histopathological images. The LYSTO hackathon, for instance, challenged participants to assess lymphocyte counts in cancer tissue samples, achieving pathologist-level accuracy. arXiv
<br>

â€‹Vaccine Design Simulation <br>
Utilize epitope prediction tools to design vaccines targeting emerging pathogens. This mirrors real-world applications where computational methods are used to predict immune responses and design effective vaccines.
<br>

â€‹Immune System Modeling <br>
Create simulations of immune responses using agent-based or system dynamics models. Such simulations can help in understanding complex immune interactions and have been highlighted as valuable educational tools. arXiv

â€‹Autoimmune Disease Diagnostics <br>
Develop algorithms to detect patterns in gene expression data associated with autoimmune diseases. This aligns with ongoing research efforts to understand and diagnose autoimmune conditions through computational analysis.
