🧩 Suggested Themes & Challenges: <br>
<br>
​Provide optional thematic tracks to guide students and encourage focused innovation:<br>
<br>
​Health Diagnostics: e.g., detecting biomarkers like glucose, cortisol, viruses, toxins.<br>
<br>
​Environmental Monitoring: e.g., multi-target detection of pollutants, heavy metals, or toxins (think multi-mycotoxin detection like OTA in wine using graphene aptamersarXiv).<br>
<br>
​Food Safety & Agriculture: e.g., detect pathogens, allergens, or food spoilage markers.<br>
<br>
​Wearables & IoT Integration: e.g., continuous monitoring via wearables or deployable sensor systems.<br>

​What is are the multi-molecular biosensors available datasets?<br>
​<br>
<br>
​1. Koch et al. (2018) – Detectable Molecules Dataset <br>
​A manually curated dataset of compounds that can be sensed by genetically encoded, transcription factor–based biosensors. It includes: <br>
​Compound names, InChI structures, organism or context, detection experimental details, biosensor names, plus commentary on inclusion rationale. <br>
​Sourced from Bionemo, RegTransbase, RegulonDB, RegPrecise, Sigmol, and manual curation of ACS Synthetic Biology literature. <br>
​Freely available via GitHub: github.com/brsynth/detectable_metabolitesPMC. <br>

<br>
<br>
​2. Sensbio Database <br>
​An expanded and more accessible form of the Koch dataset. Sensbio includes: <br>
​TF-ligand interaction pairs, with molecular details (SMILES, InChI), transcription factor sequences, species source, and metabolic context. <br>
​A toolbox for querying by chemical similarity (Fingerprints + Tanimoto), sequence similarity (BLAST), and predictive modeling. <br>
​Dataset integration from Bionemo, RegulonDB, RegPrecise, RegTransBase, Sigmol, GroovDB, and literatureBioMed Central. <br>

<br>
<br>
​3. "Table of Biosensors" (Townshend et al., 2022) <br>
​A dataset cataloging biosensor sequences and their responses: <br>
​Contains sequences of sensors tested against 267 compounds (at 10 μM), with fold-change data (≥2x, 3x, 5x, 8x). <br>
​Organized into 150 clusters based on compounds that trigger them. <br>
​Includes compound identities, response magnitudes, and sensor sequencesFigshare. <br>

<br>
<br>
​4. Cell Painting Gallery (Image-based Profiling) <br>
​While not a “biosensor” in the traditional sense, this resource offers: <br>
​High-dimensional image data of cellular phenotypes under chemical or genetic perturbations, measured via extensive staining protocols ("multi-molecular" profiling). <br>
​Encompasses 656 TB of data on AWS, including the JUMP consortium datasetsarXiv. <br>
​Particularly useful if you aim to link molecular perturbation to morphological responses. <br>

<br>
<br>
​5. M³-20M: Multi-Modal Molecule Dataset <br>
​A massive, multi-modal dataset of more than 20 million molecules, integrating: <br>
​SMILES, 2D graphs, 3D structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions. <br>
​Primarily intended for AI-driven drug design and molecular generation/prediction—but its rich, comprehensive molecular representations can support biosensor modeling as wellarXiv+1. <br>

<br>
<br>
​6. Other Molecular Machine-Learning Benchmarks <br>
​These are broader molecular datasets that support predictive modeling, not specifically biosensors: <br>
​MoleculeNet – a benchmark suite of diverse molecular property datasets for ML (via DeepChem)arXiv. <br>
​OGB-MolPCBA – curated from MoleculeNet to address domain generalization issues in molecular property predictionwilds.stanford.edu. <br>
​Alchemy – dataset of ~120K molecules with quantum mechanical properties, useful for modeling purposesarXiv. <br>

<br>
​Recommendation <br>
​If you're specifically focused on multi-molecular TF-based biosensors, start with: <br>
<br>
​Koch et al. (2018) dataset – solid foundation, manually curated. <br>
<br>
​Sensbio – excellent next step with enhanced querying and predictive modeling. <br>
<br>
​Table of Biosensors (2022) – adds real experimental response data, sequences. <br>
<br>
​If your work is broader—e.g. image-based perturbation profiling or AI-driven molecule generation—then: <br>
​Cell Painting Gallery and/or M³-20M offer deep, versatile datasets.
